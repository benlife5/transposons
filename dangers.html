      <p> Even though most transposons are harmless, some are responsible for causing life-threatening diseases.</p>
      <h4>Cancer</h4>
      <p> Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that LINE-1, one of the most prevalent class of transposable elements in human DNA, repeatedly copied and pasted itself in the DNA of colon cancer cells. Although their exact role within these colon cancer cells is not clear, they have the potential for wreaking havoc by inserting themselves in segments along the DNA where they do not belong.</p>
      <h4>Schizophrenia</h4>
      <p> The LINE-1 transposon can be found in human stem cells in the brain, which eventually transform into neurons. Because of this, LINE-1 plays an essential role in the growth and survival of neurons. Research from scientists at the University of California, San Diego found that an increase in LINE-1 has direct links to mental disorders, most notably Schizophrenia.</p>
      <h4>Alzheimer's</h4>
      <p> As we age, so do our cells, making it more difficult for them to control transposons from relocating and replicating throughout our DNA. Since the brain happens to host a lot of transposon activity, the aging of our cells accelerates any damage that transposons could cause to our brain function, with the risk of Alzheimer's and other age-related neurological disorders considerably increasing as a result. </p>
