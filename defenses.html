      <h4>Methylation</h4>

      <p>One common way DNA replication is repressed is methylation. Methylation can occur by adding a methyl group to cytosine or adenine. Once a section of DNA is methylated, the cell acts differently on that section, often not by expressing it. The expression of transposons is usually what causes their duplication, so a methylating transposon is often a good cellular strategy for containing them.</p>
      <p>The transposon family Alu accounts for ~10% of human DNA. Alus also contain 9 times more C followed by G sequences than human DNA in general. Methylation almost always occurs on a C followed by a G. As a result, Alu genes account for 33% of potential methylation sites and are almost totally methylated in human cells.<a href="#1" class="citation">[1]</a></p>

      <h4>RNA Interference Pathway</h4>
      <p>An ancient but still active cellular mechanism is the RNA Interference Pathway (or RNAi). RNAi serves an immune system targeting viruses and transposons by identifying harmful RNA and destroying it.</p>
      <p>The cell produces small sequences of RNA called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs join with a RNAi-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) which then targets and destroys specific mRNA sequences. In this way, RISC is similar to a CRISPR system but for RNA.</p>
      <p>The RNA Interference Pathway has been studied primarily in fruit flies (Drosophila) and plans, but has also been found in mammals.<a href="#2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
